# Legacy 1B demo assets

These files were part of earlier 1B-model cache-aware demos. Theyâ€™re archived here to avoid
conflicts with the canonical KV-cache-aware routing demo used by the blog.

Use the canonical demo under:
- assets/llm-d/ (Gateway, HTTPRoute, decode Service, ModelService)
- assets/envoyfilter-epp.yaml (EPP ext-proc)
- assets/inference-crs.yaml (InferencePool/InferenceModel)
- assets/cache-aware/tekton/cache-hit-pipeline.yaml (validator)

Do not apply these legacy files alongside the canonical demo.
