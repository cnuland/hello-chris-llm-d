- **Cross-References**: Links to main README for architecture details and UI components
- **Focused Scope**: Pure deployment steps, troubleshooting, and API endpoints
- **Reduced Redundancy**: Eliminated overlapping content with main README

### ‚úÖ **METRICS_DEBUG_GUIDE.md** - Specialized Troubleshooting
- **Maintained Focus**: Kept detailed debugging commands and diagnostic procedures
- **Added Reference**: Links to main README for monitoring setup context
- **Technical Depth**: Preserved all technical troubleshooting content
- **Clear Scope**: Dedicated to metrics collection issues only

### ‚úÖ **TESTING_GUIDE.md** - Test Execution Focus
- **Streamlined Content**: Focused on test execution and verification steps
- **Cross-References**: Links to main README for demo scenarios and GuideLLM README for setup
- **Maintained Value**: Kept all technical testing procedures and checklists
- **Clear Dependencies**: References related documentation appropriately

### ‚úÖ **assets/README.md** - Asset Deployment Focus
- **Focused Content**: Concentrated on asset directory structure and deployment
- **Added Reference**: Links to main README for comprehensive architecture details
- **Technical Details**: Preserved all deployment-specific information
- **Clear Scope**: Asset deployment and configuration only

### ‚úÖ **guidellm/README.md** - GuideLLM Specifics
- **Added Integration**: Links to main README for performance benchmarks context
- **Preserved Content**: Maintained all GuideLLM-specific setup and configuration
- **Clear Integration**: Shows how GuideLLM fits into the broader LLM-D demo

- Clear pointers to specialized information
- Consistent cross-referencing system

### üõ†Ô∏è **Maintenance Efficiency**
- Single source of truth for common information
- Reduced need to update multiple files for shared content
- Clear ownership of content sections

## üìã **Content Distribution**

| Document | Primary Focus | Key Sections |
|----------|---------------|--------------|
| **README.md** | Complete project overview | Architecture, Features, Monitoring, Development, Benchmarks |
| **DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md** | Deployment steps | Registry setup, K8s deployment, Access methods |
| **METRICS_DEBUG_GUIDE.md** | Metrics troubleshooting | Diagnostic commands, Common issues, Debug procedures |
| **TESTING_GUIDE.md** | Test execution | GuideLLM tests, P/D verification, Performance validation |
| **assets/README.md** | Asset deployment | Directory structure, Component deployment, Configuration |
| **guidellm/README.md** | GuideLLM setup | Pipeline deployment, Configuration, Integration |

## üéâ **Result**

The documentation is now well-organized, non-redundant, and provides clear navigation paths for users whether they're:
- Getting started (main README)
- Deploying the application (DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE)
- Troubleshooting metrics (METRICS_DEBUG_GUIDE)
- Running tests (TESTING_GUIDE)
- Working with specific components (assets/ and guidellm/ READMEs)

All documents maintain their technical depth while eliminating redundancy and improving the overall user experience.
