# Mastering KV-Cache-Aware Routing with llm-d

*By Christopher Nuland, Technical Marketing Manager for Red Hat AI*

## Introduction

In the era of large-scale AI inference, ensuring efficiency across distributed environments is no longer optional—it's a necessity. As workloads grow, so does the need for smarter scheduling and memory reuse strategies. Enter **llm-d**, a Kubernetes-native framework for scalable, intelligent LLM inference. One of its most powerful capabilities is **KV-cache-aware routing**, which reduces latency and improves throughput by directing requests to pods that already hold relevant context in GPU memory.

In this blog post, we’ll cover:

- What KV-cache-aware routing is and why it matters  
- How llm-d implements this feature with EPPs, Gateway API Inference Extension, and intelligent routing  
- The critical Kubernetes YAML assets that make it work  
- A test case showing our latest 87.4% cache hit rate  
- Where to go to learn more and get started

## What Is llm-d?

**llm-d** is an open source project built by Red Hat and the AI infrastructure community to manage large-scale LLM inference using cloud-native patterns. llm-d introduces:

- Disaggregated **prefill and decode** workloads  
- **Multi-model** and multi-tenant isolation  
- **Intelligent routing** via an External Processing Pod (EPP)  
- And crucially, **KV-cache-aware routing** for memory-efficient, low-latency inference  

---

## The Problem: Stateless Inference Fails to Reuse Cache

In traditional deployments, even if KV-caches are enabled inside the model server (like vLLM), the **gateway is unaware of cache state**. That leads to:

- Round-robin routing or explicit sticky sessions  
- Frequent **cache misses**  
- Repeated compute for common prefixes  
- Unnecessary GPU memory use  

This breaks down under high concurrency or workloads with shared prompts (like RAG, chat history, or templated inputs).

---

## The Solution: KV-Cache-Aware Routing

llm-d enables **state-aware request scheduling** by introducing the **Gateway API Inference Extension (GAIE)** with an External Processing Pod (EPP), a high-performance system that maintains intelligent routing decisions based on KV-cache awareness. The key components include:

- A **Gateway API Inference Extension (GAIE) EPP** that orchestrates intelligent scoring of pods for optimal cache utilization
- An **in-memory LRU caching system** that tracks cache state across vLLM pods without external dependencies
- A **pod discovery and labeling system** that automatically identifies and monitors decode service endpoints
- A **session-aware routing algorithm** that maintains request consistency for optimal cache reuse
- A **prefix-aware scoring system** that intelligently routes requests based on prompt similarity and cache warmth

The result is a scheduling layer that routes requests to pods most likely to have relevant cached content—dramatically reducing inference times and GPU load.

## 🔧 Core Configurations

### Deployment path (official community approach)

- **Official Community Helm Charts**: The `llm-d-infra` Helm chart deploys the gateway and GAIE EPP with proper `plugins-v2.yaml` configuration. This is the recommended and supported deployment method.
- **Assets-based deployment**: Direct Kubernetes manifests for decode services, EPP configuration, and Istio EnvoyFilters work with the official infrastructure.
- **Note**: The LLM-D operator is deprecated and not recommended for new deployments. Use the official community Helm charts for reliable, production-ready installations.

### (1) Decode Service and Deployment: Direct Kubernetes Assets

The current architecture uses direct Kubernetes assets instead of the ModelService CR. This provides better control and eliminates dependencies on the deprecated operator.

## Official Community Helm Chart Approach

The current implementation uses the official LLM-D community Helm chart which automatically provisions:

- **Infrastructure Gateway**: Istio Gateway with proper configuration
- **GAIE EPP**: External Processing Pod with `plugins-v2.yaml` configuration
- **Service Discovery**: Automatic discovery of decode services via label selectors
- **No External Dependencies**: In-memory LRU caching eliminates Redis requirements

### InferencePool and InferenceModel (Auto-created)

The EPP automatically discovers and manages inference pools based on service labels. The decode service must have the label `llm-d.ai/inferenceServing: "true"` for automatic discovery.

**EPP Service Configuration (Deployed by Helm Chart):**
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: llm-d-gaie-epp
  namespace: llm-d
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: llm-d-gaie-epp
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: llm-d-gaie-epp
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: epp
        image: # Official GAIE EPP image from community
        ports:
        - containerPort: 9002
          name: grpc
        env:
        - name: PLUGINS_CONFIG_PATH
          value: "/etc/config/plugins-v2.yaml"
        volumeMounts:
        - name: config
          mountPath: /etc/config
      volumes:
      - name: config
        configMap:
          name: llm-d-gaie-epp-config
```

Validation signals:
- EPP logs show successful pod discovery: "Found decode services with labels"
- Gateway successfully routes requests through EPP
- GET /v1/models via the gateway returns model list with 200 status

## 🔍 KV-Cache Indexer: Deep Architecture Dive

The **KV-Cache Indexer** is the brain of llm-d's intelligent routing system. It maintains a global, near-real-time view of KV-Cache block locality across your entire vLLM fleet. Here's how it works:

### Core Architecture Components

| Component | Purpose | Implementation |
|:----------|:--------|:---------------|
| **`kvcache.Indexer`** | Main orchestrator handling scoring requests | Coordinates all internal modules |
| **`kvevents.Pool`** | Ingests KV-cache events from vLLM pods | Sharded ZMQ worker pool for real-time event processing |
| **`kvblock.Index`** | Core data store mapping block hashes to pods | In-memory two-level LRU cache for sub-millisecond lookups |
| **`tokenization.PrefixStore`** | Caches tokenized prompt prefixes | LRU cache avoiding expensive re-tokenization |
| **`kvblock.TokenProcessor`** | Converts tokens into KV-block keys | Chunking and hashing algorithm matching vLLM exactly |
| **`kvblock.Scorer`** | Scores pods based on cache hit sequences | Longest consecutive prefix matching strategy |

### The Read Path: Intelligent Pod Scoring

When a router needs to select the best pod for a new prompt, the **Read Path** finds the pod with the longest sequence of relevant cached KV-blocks:

1. **Token Retrieval**: Check the `PrefixStore` for the longest cached token sequence for the prompt prefix
2. **Key Generation**: Convert tokens into deterministic KV-block keys that match vLLM's internal logic
3. **Index Lookup**: Query the `kvblock.Index` to find which pods have the consecutive blocks
4. **Scoring**: Rank each pod based on consecutive matching blocks from the start of the prompt
5. **Response**: Return scored pod rankings to the router

**Key Insight**: First-time prompts may return empty results while background tokenization occurs, but common prompts achieve sub-millisecond scoring.

### The Write Path: Real-Time Cache Tracking

The **Write Path** keeps the index synchronized with actual vLLM pod cache states:

1. **Event Publication**: vLLM pods publish cache events (`BlockStored`, `BlockRemoved`) via ZMQ
2. **Message Reception**: Events parsed by topic format: `kv@pod-id@model`
3. **Sharded Processing**: Pod ID hashed (FNV-1a) to ensure ordered processing per pod
4. **Event Decoding**: Worker decodes msgpack payloads containing event batches
5. **Index Updates**: Apply cache changes to the in-memory `kvblock.Index`

### Hash Compatibility & Block Generation

Critical for accuracy, the indexer **perfectly matches vLLM's content-addressing logic**:

- **Token Chunking**: Prompts tokenized and grouped into fixed chunks (default: 16)
- **Chained Hashing**: SHA-256 hash of CBOR-encoded `[parentHash, tokenChunk, extraKeys]`
- **Hash Seed Alignment**: Must match `PYTHONHASHSEED` environment variable across all vLLM pods
- **64-bit Keys**: Uses lower 64 bits of SHA-256 for efficient storage and lookup

### Performance Optimizations

**Async Tokenization**: New prompts don't block scoring requests—tokenization happens in background worker pools with cached Hugging Face tokenizer instances.

**Two-Level LRU Caching**: The index maps block keys to pod sets using nested LRU caches for both speed and memory efficiency.

**Sharded Event Processing**: Pod events processed in parallel while maintaining per-pod ordering guarantees.

```

### (2) vLLM Prefix Caching Configuration

Each vLLM pod is configured for optimal prefix caching performance:

```yaml
args:
  - "--enable-prefix-caching"             # Enable KV-cache prefix reuse
  - "--block-size=16"                     # Optimal block size for cache efficiency
  - "--gpu-memory-utilization=0.7"        # Reserve memory for cache storage
  - "--max-model-len=4096"                # Match expected prompt lengths
  - "--kv-cache-dtype=auto"               # Automatic cache data type optimization
env:
  - name: CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES            # GPU assignment for cache isolation
    value: "0"
```

### (3) EnvoyFilter for GAIE EPP Integration

Enables the GAIE EPP to intercept and route requests based on intelligent pod scoring:

```yaml
name: envoy.filters.http.ext_proc
typed_config:
  grpc_service:
    envoy_grpc:
      cluster_name: epp-ext-proc-cluster  # Cluster pointing to GAIE EPP service
  processing_mode:
    request_header_mode: SEND     # Send request headers for routing analysis
    response_header_mode: SEND    # Send response headers for session tracking
    request_body_mode: STREAMED   # Stream request bodies for prompt analysis
  failure_mode_allow: true        # Continue routing if EPP unavailable
  message_timeout: 30s            # Allow time for intelligent scoring
```

## ⚡ TTFT Impact: Measurable Performance Gains

One of the most immediate and noticeable benefits of KV-cache-aware routing is the dramatic improvement in **Time To First Token (TTFT)**. Here's how cache hits directly translate to faster inference:

### Baseline vs. Cache-Aware Performance

| Scenario | Without Cache Routing | With KV-Cache Routing | Improvement |
|:---------|:---------------------|:---------------------|:-----------|
| **Cold Inference** | 2,850ms TTFT | 2,850ms TTFT | Baseline |
| **Warm Cache Hit** | 2,850ms TTFT | **340ms TTFT** | **88% faster** |
| **Partial Cache Hit** | 2,850ms TTFT | 1,420ms TTFT | 50% faster |

### Real-World TTFT Measurements

**Test Configuration:**
- Model: meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct
- Prompt Length: 1,024 tokens (typical RAG context)
- Cache Block Size: 16 tokens
- GPU: NVIDIA A100 40GB

### Why Cache Hits Improve TTFT

**1. Eliminated Prefill Computation**
- **Cache Miss**: Must compute attention for all 1,024 input tokens
- **Cache Hit**: Reuses cached KV-blocks, only computes new tokens
- **Savings**: 64 cache blocks × 16 tokens = 1,024 tokens of prefill avoided

**2. Memory Access Patterns**
- **Cache Miss**: Cold GPU memory, cache misses in attention computation
- **Cache Hit**: Warm GPU memory with pre-computed attention states
- **Result**: 5-8x faster attention computation for cached portions

**3. Reduced Model Loading**
- **Cache Miss**: May require model parameter loading if pod was idle
- **Cache Hit**: Model already loaded and warm from recent inference
- **Benefit**: Eliminates 200-500ms model loading overhead

### Production TTFT Distribution

**From our 87.4% cache hit rate performance test:**

### TTFT Performance Profile (4,776 requests)

| Request Type | Count | Percentage | LLM-Instance-1 | LLM-Instance-2 | LLM-Instance-3 | Notes |

  buckets: [50, 100, 200, 500, 1000, 2000, 5000]
  labels: [model, cache_status, session_id]

ttft_improvement_ratio:
  calculation: (baseline_ttft - cache_hit_ttft) / baseline_ttft
  target: > 70% improvement for cache hits

cache_effectiveness_score:
  formula: (cache_hit_rate × ttft_improvement_ratio)
  target: > 60% (indicating high cache utilization with good performance gains)
```

The **87.4% cache hit rate achieving 85% TTFT improvement** represents a production system where the vast majority of users experience near-instantaneous responses, fundamentally transforming the user experience from "waiting for AI" to "AI keeping up with thought."

## OpenShift-specific Notes

### Gateway exposure and hostnames
- You can expose the Istio Inference Gateway via an OpenShift Route.
- Ensure your HTTPRoute hostnames include the external Route/Ingress host. For in-cluster tests, use Host: llm-d.demo.local.

### SCC and sidecar injection
- If images require non-root or additional capabilities, grant anyuid/privileged SCC to the service accounts as needed, or use compliant images.
- For non-model sample apps (frontend/backend) you may disable Istio sidecar injection to avoid NET_ADMIN/NET_RAW bootstrap issues on OpenShift. These apps are optional and not core to cache-aware routing.

### EPP readiness troubleshooting
- If EPP startup is slow, consider TCP-based readiness/liveness probes or increasing initial delay.
- Healthy logs: look for reconciliation activity and disappearance of "Pool is not initialized" messages.
