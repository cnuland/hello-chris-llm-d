# Archived Documentation Index

These documents have been archived as part of consolidating documentation into a streamlined README and a few focused references. They are retained here for historical context and deeper dives when needed.

If any link breaks due to this re-organization, update references to point here or to the new canonical docs listed in the README.

Primary docs to use going forward
- README.md (Getting Started, Architecture, Monitoring)
- monitoring/README.md (monitoring specifics)
- assets/cache-aware/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md (deep architecture)
- assets/cache-aware/docs/METRICS.md (metrics details)
- blog/ (unchanged; authoritative technical outline)

Archived files (moved here)
- CONFIGMAP_MIGRATION_COMPLETE.md — one-off migration note
- README-POC.md — early proof-of-concept README
- deployment-guide.md — superseded by README Getting Started
- kv-cache-routing.md — content covered by ARCHITECTURE and blog
- KV-Cache-Aware-Routing-Details.md — details consolidated into architecture refs
- llm-d-comprehensive-demo-guide.md — long-form demo script, superseded by blog and README
- metrics-debug-guide.md — troubleshooting folded into monitoring README and metrics refs
- cache-aware-routing.md — overlaps with ARCHITECTURE and blog
- assets/demo-cache-aware-routing.md — demo notes rolled into README and blog
- blog-post-draft.md — draft retained but moved out of root
- testing-guide.md — guidance folded into README and scripts
- docs/versions.md — version notes; keep here for reference
- gpu/gpu-config.md — environment-specific details; keep here

If you want any of these restored to active docs, let me know which to bring back and where to link them from.
